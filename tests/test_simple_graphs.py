"""
Test the Louvain and Leiden algorithms on simple graphs.

The algorithms are tested against two small graphs, so that the results are traceable by a human.

A note regarding randomness:
Both the Louvain and the Leiden algorithm are randomized algorithms.
To have reproducible test results, every test in this file seeds the random number generator to a constant, predefined value.
This way, the tests are reproducible and the resulting partitions do not change in every test execution.
As we only have a handful of (relevant) reference partitions, some seeds are chosen so that the execution results in a certain partition,
as is the case with the example of the weighted (4,0) barbell graph in the later section of this file.

# partition of the unweighted input graph.

# Due to the randomized nature of the algorithms, we seed the random number generator used so that we get the expected
# communities. Due to the greedy nature of the louvain algorithm, we will never reach BARBELL_GOOD, but nodes 5 and 6
# will often belong to one of the communities belonging to one or both of the complete graphs.
